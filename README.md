#Medley
An intelligent music player. NOTE: Development on this project has been halted temporarily in favor of a web-based player.

## Overview

variety of online sources. Inspired by the Tomahawk music player, Medley can be used to:
   
* Create playlists across music services
* Search for music and find the best stream on the internet
* Get recommendations based on other user preferences
